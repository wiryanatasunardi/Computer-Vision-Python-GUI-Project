# Computer-Vision-Python-GUI-Project
This is a computer vision project using the OpenCV library integrated with GUI using the PyQt5 library. This project consists of a supermarket analyzer used to analyze supermarket activity and hand gesture recognition using the MediaPipe library. Besides that, this project is also integrated with Firebase as the online database for the user.

## Login Page

The login page is designed using the Qt Designer app, which consists of buttons to help users use the application easily. Besides that, I also added a signup page that will direct new users to create an account on the application. Both the signup and login pages are integrated with Firebase as the online database. Using Firebase, the administrator could easily monitor the application activity since it is also provided with a graph to make it easily visualized.
